Protoplanetary disks are the known birthplace of planets. Recent observations with ALMA at sub-mm wavelengths and with the latest generation of high-contrast imagers at near-IR wavelengths have revealed a wide diversity of structures in these disks. It is yet unclear how all these structures are connected to embedded planets.  
The direct observation of planetary systems is a promising approach to study planet formation. High-Contrast imaging (HCI) encompasses both the development of techniques necessary for the direct observations of extra-solar systems and the subsequent characterization of directly imaged objects. 
 
State-of-the-art algorithms to process HCI observations are focused on exoplanet detection. Due to the inappropriate use for extended signals of methods designed for point-like sources, many protoplanet claims that have been made in the recent years could be false positives. Similarly, disk features might have been left unanalyzed due to the known deformation induced by these algorithms - hence the need for a better technique. 
The goal of my research project can be summarized by the following three main axes: 
<ol type="1">
<li> Develop novel methods based on inverse problem approaches, for the unbiased extraction of faint signals, either extended or compact in the vicinity of bright stars (e.g. circumstellar discs and exoplanets), leveraging different observing strategies used in high-contrast imaging. 
  </li>
<li> Benchmark the methods using radiative transfer models and hydrodynamical simulations of protoplanetary disks. 
</li>
<li> Apply the new methods to both archival and new high-contrast imaging datasets in order to a) detect new protoplanet candidates, b) confirm or disprove previous protoplanet claims, c) image at high fidelity extended disk structures like spiral arms or other planet signposts. 
</li>
</ol>
